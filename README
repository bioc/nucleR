This builds on the original nucleR package, written by Oscar Flores.

New features (TODO):
    Update to use newer bioconductor functions
    Add functions to process BAM files
    Merge with the NucleosomeDynamics library to analyze nucleosome profiles comparatively

nucleR is a R/Bioconductor package for working with tiling arrays and next generation sequencing. It uses a novel aproach in this field which comprises a deep profile cleaning using Fourier Transform and peak scoring for a quick and flexible nucleosome calling.
